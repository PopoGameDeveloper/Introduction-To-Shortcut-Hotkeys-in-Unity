# Introduction-To-Shortcut-Hotkeys-in-Unity

Unity is an incredible tool for developers to create cross-platform content quickly. However, many developers haven’t fully harnessed Unity’s potential to boost speed and efficiency in their work.
In this post, we’ll share tips on shortcuts and hotkeys that will speed up your workflow and enhance your productivity while using Unity. Don’t miss the opportunity to optimize your development experience!

<H1>What is a Hotkey? </H1>
A "hotkey" refers to a key or combination of keys on the keyboard that is linked to a specific command within a program or platform.
In this guide, we will use the term hotkey to refer to a single key command that you can use to easily switch between different tools or actions within Unity.

# What are Shortcuts?
Shortcuts are key combinations that are linked to certain tools or actions in whatever software you may be using. Unity has many shortcuts that are “baked-in” to the software, but you can create and customize your own shortcuts to work seamlessly with your workflow. 
First, we’ll outline some of the default shortcuts within Unity, then show you how you can create your own.

# How to Add or Change Shortcuts in Unity
While these pre-built shortcuts may work for most developers, you may want to alter your workspace to make them more adaptive to their work style. Thankfully, Resolve makes it easy to do that by allowing you to reassign new shortcuts and hotkeys to tools or actions. 
Follow these steps to add or change your shortcuts and hotkeys in Unity:
**Step 1:** Locate the Shortcuts Manager in Unity’s main menu.
- For Windows, go to "Edit," then select "Shortcuts."
- For Mac, go to "Unity," then select "Shortcuts."

**Step 2:** You will now get a pop-up window that shows a keyboard layout and commands that are organized by category. Now, you want to choose whether you want to make a command “global” or “contextual.” 
- Global commands are commands that are always available. This means that, for example, whenever you press certain keys linked to the global command for “Undo,” it will always undo the previous action regardless of what windows or tools are currently active.
- Contextual commands are linked to a certain view or toolset; for example, they only work when you are in the Animation window. 
Something to keep in mind when editing global and contextual commands is that they can create shortcut conflicts. So you want to be careful to keep track of which commands are global and which are contextual when changing and customizing shortcuts.

**Step 3:** If you would like to assign an action to a single key, select that command from the command menu and drag and drop it to the key you would like to assign it to. If you would like to add a modifier key to the command, such as Shift or Option, hold that key or keys down while dragging and dropping the command to the keyboard.

## To unassign or reset shortcuts: 

**Step 1:** Right-click the key you want to unassign or reset.  
**Step 2:** From the menu that appears, select “reset to default” or “remove shortcut” to either reset the key to its default shortcut assignment or remove the shortcut entirely.
